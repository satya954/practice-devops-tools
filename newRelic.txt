											NewRelic:
											========
Software As A Service	=>	SAAS 
We no need to install the tool / service.

First started in 2008.
	APM -	Application Performance monitoring.
	
Synthetics	:
--------------
	Monitoring the API's.

##############################	
Different types of Monitors:
##############################
1. Ping					-	Rest API
2. Simple Browser		-	Application / Website
3. Scripted Browser		-	Test the website with some script. [ Get some examples & see it through google - docs.newrelic.com  ]
4. API test				-	Uses an http client to monitor remote API endpoints. ( REST / HealthCheck / etc ..)
							Similiar to ping, but we can also Provide credentials here  where as in PING, we can't 

I. Ping:
========
Select Ping

Name: Employee service
URL: <url-here>				// This is an API URL.
Validation string: (optional) - no need
Monitoring Locations:
	Select any

Check the interval:
	1 min	[ Default will be 10 min ]
	
Create.

			It will start , chekcking /monitoring the API you have specified in the URL context.
			
And you can see the stats / response of that URL in the Explorer Tab.

Example: The response time will be seen in the chart from all the locations you have selected before.
O/P:	The response time will be higher from the other regions except Mumbai ( where we have deployed our application ).

		To get rid of the higher response time's, you can reduce it by:
		1. Deploying the application in that specific region
		2. Cache in edge locations

Based on the region from where the request is coming, we will configure the routing request should go to that particular region deployed application.


Alerts & AI:
===========
	For free accounts, this wont be supported.
	Using these, you can able to integrate with the Slack and get notifications.
	
II. Simple Browser:
===================
